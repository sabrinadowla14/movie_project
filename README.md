Programming Foundations with Python

Documentation of my Project:

I wrote server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies.
It generates a static web page allowing visitors to browse\
 their movies and watch the trailers.

1. I have installed Python 2.7
2. Created a data structure movie.py -- a Python Class to store my favorite movies\
   included movie title, poster URL and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
3. In movie_gallery.py created multiple instances of that Python Class (movie.py)\
   group all the instances together in a list called movies.
   
4. Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py to help generate\
   a website that displays these movies. 
   This module has a function called open_movies_page\
   that takes in one argument,
   which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file\
   which visualizes all of my favorite movies.
   The structure of the code is taken from the instructors note.
   Links and contents are taken from the YouTube website.
   
   Steps to Run a Python Program:
   Step1: Go to the folder and Right click movie_gallery.py file\
   and open it in python 2.7 IDLE.
   Step2: Go to Run and click F5
   Step3: In the browser review the movies and watch the trailers.
   
   
   Checked my code using Pep8 and also autopep8
   
   Issues:
   I was not able make the poster url (.jpg ) to 79 charecter length.
   If I make it 79 charecter length I could not see the\
   output of the poster of that link.
